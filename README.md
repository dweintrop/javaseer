javaseer
========
This project includes a script that aliases the javac command enabling us to keep track of the programs students write and the compilation output. It takes these repsonses and pushes them to a server for logging.

This project includes both the script to setup the alias as well as a django site that the scrpits pushes runs to and stores them.
